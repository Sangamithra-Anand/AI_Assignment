"""
__init__.py
-----------------------
This file marks the src/ directory as a Python package.

Why this file is needed:
- Allows importing functions from different modules such as:
      from src.load_data import load_raw_data
- Helps avoid import errors when running the project.

We don't need to write any code here unless we want to expose
package-wide variables or shortcuts.

For now, this file is intentionally left empty.
"""

# You may choose to expose common functions here (optional), example:
# from .load_data import load_raw_data
# from .preprocess import preprocess_data
